# MARL-eval for MAM

Note: I did do some finagling with the number of evaluations between LBF, SMAX and RWARE. In particular, I downsampled where necessary using \texttt{json_edit.py}. I also had to manually set some colours when generating performance profiles.

The final plots for the MAM paper are inside \texttt{plots_final}.

The final concatenated data files are as follows:
- \texttt{concatenated_json_files_ablation_delta}
- \texttt{concatenated_json_files_ablation_latent_state}
- \texttt{concatenated_json_files_lbf}
- \texttt{concatenated_json_files_rware}
- \texttt{concatenated_json_files_smax}
